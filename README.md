# Shield_Display
Arduino code used in the replica shield LEDs for my Shield Hero prop.

Example of it in use: https://www.instagram.com/p/CspKdrHPUf9/

This is basically to create a loop of lights slowly rising and falling, as well as including a switch pin to make all the lights a bright solid color when necessary.
